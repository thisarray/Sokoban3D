# Sokoban3D
Sokoban implementation in first-person perspective.

All Sokoban implementations I see feature a top-down view of the entire level.
This feels like a cheat because you know where everything is.
I thought a Sokoban implementation in first-person perspective would be more challenging because you have to explore first to get the lay of the land.
Once you have a mental picture of the level, then you can plan your moves.

The idea is a remix of

- [Star Pusher](https://thisarray.github.io/making-games-with-python-and-pygame/starpusher/starpusher.html)
